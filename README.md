## Usage

Add Node BACstack to your project by using:

``` sh
npm install --save bacstack
```

The API documentation is available under **[fh1ch.github.io/node-bacstack](https://fh1ch.github.io/node-bacstack)**.

### Features

The BACNET standard defines a wide variety of services as part of it's
specification. While Node BACstack tries to be as complete as possible,
following services are already supported at this point in time:

| Service                        | Execute                                                                                | Handle                                                                        |

¹ Support implemented as Beta (untested, undocumented, breaking interface)

### Example

``` js
const bacnet = require('bacstack');

// Initialize BACStack
const client = new bacnet({apduTimeout: 6000});

// Discover Devices
client.on('iAm', (device) => {
  console.log('address: ', device.address);
  console.log('deviceId: ', device.deviceId);
  console.log('maxApdu: ', device.maxApdu);
  console.log('segmentation: ', device.segmentation);
  console.log('vendorId: ', device.vendorId);
});
client.whoIs();

// Read Device Object
const requestArray = [{
  objectId: {type: 8, instance: 4194303},
  properties: [{id: 8}]
}];
client.readPropertyMultiple('192.168.1.43', requestArray, (err, value) => {
  console.log('value: ', value);
});
```
